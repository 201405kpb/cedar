# Cedar

Cedar is a library for crafting, sharing and data visualizations powered by ArcGIS Services. Built with D3 and the Vega graphics grammar, Cedar extends them with bindings for making templated chart graphics that can be re-used with different datasets. 

At the highest level, Cedar provides a simple chart API. Beyond that it is possible to create new and unique chart types that can be loaded and customized through interactions and styling depending on your needs.

**Currently Esri Cedar is in development and should be thought of as a beta or preview.**

### Demos
There are is a [simple user interface](http://dbouwman.github.com/cypress] and [a few demos](http://esridc.github.io/cedar/) showing the basic concepts of Cedar.

### Example
Here is a quick example to get you started. Just change the paths to point to the proper libraries and go.

```html
<h2>DC Schools</h2>
<div id="dc_capacity"></div>
<div id="dc_use"></div>

<h2>Utah Planning</h2>
<div id="bar"></div>
<div id="word"></div>

<script type="text/javascript" src="http://square.github.io/crossfilter/d3.v3.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://trifacta.github.io/vega/vega.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="chart.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="cedar.js"></script>

<script type="text/javascript">
  // DC
  Cedar.chart({el: "#dc_capacity", style: "scatter", data: "/schools.json", x: "CAPACITY", y: "POPULATION_ENROLLED_2008", color: "FACUSE"})
  Cedar.chart({el: "#dc_use", style: "bar", data: "/schools_use_count.json", count: "POPULATION_ENROLLED_2008", group: "FACUSE"})
  // Utah
  Cedar.chart({el: "#bar", style: "bar", data: "/utah.json", count: "PROJECT_VALUE", group: "PRIMARY_CONCEPT"})
  // Cedar.chart({el: "#word", style: "word", data: "/data.json", value: "PROJECT_VALUE", text: "PRIMARY_CONCEPT"})
