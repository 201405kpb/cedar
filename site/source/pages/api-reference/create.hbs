## Cedar.create( template, mappings )
Compile a chart template with a set of field mappings and data (url | object ) to generate a cedar chart that can be used with the `.show()` method. This will be used in tools that allow a user to associate a chart template with data + styling.

*NOTE*: If the data is passed in as an array, it will be embedded into the chart json that is emitted. (not implemented yet)
